# RandomWalkerProblem

Question1:
N random walkers start out together at the origin and they make their random steps simultaneously in two dimensions. Determine the number of random walkers to be found 
at a distance r, where r = sqrt(sqr(x)+sqr(y)) from the origin after M steps. You need to plot the probabilities. For this problem, you could use either the Cartesian coordinate system or the spherical coordinate system.

Question2:
N random walkers start out together at the origin and they make their random steps simultaneously in three dimensions. Determine the number (S(r)) of random walkers to be found at a distance r (that is, between r and r+dr, where dr is an infinitesimally small number) from the origin after M steps. You need to plot S(r) versus r graph. For this problem, you could use either the Cartesian coordinate system or the spherical coordinate system.
